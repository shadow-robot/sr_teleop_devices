# Shuttle Xpress

This is a driver for the Contour Shuttle Xpress controller.

I took some inspiration from this [link](http://www.orangecoat.com/how-to/read-and-decode-data-from-your-mouse-using-this-pyusb-hack)

## ROS communication

This node simply publishes a **~state** topic of the type **shuttle_xpress/ShuttleExpress.msg**.

## Install

### Proper pyusb version
*TODO use rosdep instead*
You'll need pyusb 1.0+ for this driver to work. To install it:

```
sudo pip install --upgrade --pre pyusb
```

### Accessing without sudo
I found those informations in the following [wiki](http://www.tincantools.com/wiki/Accessing_Devices_without_Sudo) to access the Shuttle Xpress without sudo.

- first make sure you're in the plugdev group.
- then create a udev file:

```
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/89-shuttle-xpress.rules
```

- Add the following udev rule to that file:

```
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0020", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0b33", MODE="666", GROUP="plugdev"
```

- Reload the rules without rebooting:
```
sudo udevadm trigger
```
